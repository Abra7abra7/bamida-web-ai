# Project Status and Roadmap

## ✅ Implemented Features & Fixes

### 1. Localization Architecture (Fixed)
- **Strategy:** Adopted "One Document Per Locale" strategy. Each language version of a page is now a separate document in the database.
- **Benefit:** Allows for fully localized slugs (e.g., `/sk/autoplachty`, `/en/car-tarpaulins`) and independent content structures for each language.
- **Resolution:** Fixed the issue where English and German pages were overwriting each other or displaying the wrong content.

### 2. Content Population (Completed)
Seed scripts have been created, refactored, and executed for all major sections:
- **Homepage:** Localized for SK, EN, DE.
- **Reklama:** All subpages (Grafika, Digitálna tlač, etc.) created.
- **Technické Textílie:** All subpages (Autoplachty, Priemysel, etc.) created.
- **Tienenie:** All subpages (Pergoly, Markízy, etc.) created.
- **Číre Fólie:** All subpages created.
- **Technológie:** Page created.
- **Referencie:** Page created for all locales.

### 3. Navigation & Routing (Fixed)
- **Menu:** The main navigation menu in [Header.tsx](file:///Users/abra/Desktop/bamida-web-ai/components/layout/Header.tsx) is fully functional and localized.
- **Translations:** Fixed missing translation keys (`referencie`, `kontakt`) in `messages/*.json` and [Header.tsx](file:///Users/abra/Desktop/bamida-web-ai/components/layout/Header.tsx).
- **Routing:** Direct links to localized subpages work correctly (e.g., `/de/technische-textilien/lkw-planen`).

## 📋 Current State
The website is functional with the following structure:
- **Frontend:** Next.js with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.
- **CMS:** Payload CMS v3 storing all content.
- **Database:** Populated with placeholder content for all sections in 3 languages.
- **Internationalization:** `next-intl` handling routing and translations.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Roadmap to Final Testing)

To prepare the website for final testing and launch, the following tasks need to be completed:

### 1. Content Refinement
- [ ] **Replace Placeholders:** The current content is generated by seed scripts. Real text and images need to be entered via the CMS Admin panel.
- [ ] **Image Migration:** Ensure all images from the old site are uploaded to Payload Media and correctly linked in the content blocks.

### 2. Advanced Localization Features
- [ ] **Language Switcher Logic:** Currently, switching languages on a subpage might not redirect to the exact translated sibling page if the slugs differ. Implement a mapping mechanism (e.g., using a `group_id` or `translation_key` field in the Pages collection) to link related documents across locales.

### 3. Functional Testing
- [ ] **Contact Form:** Verify that the contact form sends emails correctly.
- [ ] **Search Functionality:** Test the search bar in the header.
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness:** Thoroughly test the navigation menu and page layouts on mobile devices.

### 4. SEO & Performance
- [ ] **Metadata:** Verify that [generateMetadata](file:///Users/abra/Desktop/bamida-web-ai/app/%5Blocale%5D/%5B...slug%5D/page.tsx#40-82) produces the correct title and description for every page in every language.
- [ ] **Sitemap:** Generate a dynamic `sitemap.xml` that includes all localized routes.
- [ ] **Performance:** Run Lighthouse audits to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

### 5. Deployment
- [ ] **Environment Variables:** Prepare `.env` for the production environment.
- [ ] **Build Test:** Run `npm run build` to ensure there are no build-time errors.
